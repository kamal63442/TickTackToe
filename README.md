The provided code is an implementation of a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python. Let's go through the code and explain each part:

1. **Display Board Function (`display_board`):**
   - This function takes a Tic Tac Toe board as an argument and prints it to the console. It uses the IPython `clear_output` function to clear the previous output and update the display with the current state of the board.

2. **Player Input Function (`player_input`):**
   - This function prompts Player 1 to choose between 'X' and 'O' and returns a tuple with Player 1's marker and Player 2's marker accordingly.

3. **Place Marker Function (`place_marker`):**
   - This function takes the board, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a position as arguments and updates the board with the marker at the specified position.

4. **Win Check Function (`win_check`):**
   - This function checks if a player with a given marker has won the game. It checks all possible winning combinations on the board.

5. **Choose First Function (`choose_first`):**
   - This function randomly decides which player goes first.

6. **Space Check Function (`space_check`):**
   - This function checks if a space on the board is empty.

7. **Full Board Check Function (`full_board_check`):**
   - This function checks if the entire board is full, indicating a tie.

8. **Player Choice Function (`player_choice`):**
   - This function prompts the current player to enter a position where they want to place their marker.

9. **Replay Function (`replay`):**
   - This function asks the players if they want to play again and returns `True` if the answer starts with 'y'.

10. **Game Loop:**
    - The main part of the code is a while loop that represents the overall game. It initializes the board, markers, and turn order. Then, it repeatedly prompts players for their moves, checks for a win or a draw, and alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2.

11. **Print Statements:**
    - Various print statements provide information to the players, such as who goes first, prompts for moves, and announcements of game results.

12. **Execution:**
    - The game continues until the players decide not to replay.

In summary, this code implements a two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a text-based interface. Players take turns making moves, and the game continues until there is a winner or a draw. The `clear_output` function is used to update the display, making it look like the board is being redrawn with each move.
